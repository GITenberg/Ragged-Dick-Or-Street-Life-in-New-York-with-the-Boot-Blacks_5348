description: "Ragged Dick; or, Street Life in New York with the Boot Blacks is a Bildungsroman\
  \ by Horatio Alger Jr., which was serialized in Student and Schoolmate in 1867 and\
  \ expanded for publicaton as a full-length novel in May 1868 by the publisher A.\
  \ K. Loring. It was the first volume in the six-volume Ragged Dick Series and became\
  \ Alger's best-selling work. The tale follows a poor bootblack's rise to middle-class\
  \ respectability in 19th-century New York City. It had a favorable reception. Student\
  \ and Schoolmate reported their readers were delighted with the first installment,\
  \ and Putnam's Magazine thought boys would love the novel. One modern scholar considers\
  \ the story a \"puerile fantasy\" about class assimilation. The plot and theme were\
  \ repeated in Alger's subsequent novels and became the subject of parodies and satires.\n\
  Ragged Dick and Alger's Silas Snobden's Office Boy inspired the musical comedy Shine!\
  \ in 1982.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
